This directory contains a LaTeX document class, az.cls, written for
Chi-kwan Chan's Ph.D. thesis, and a simple example that uses it.

The document class is based on two style files floating around in the
Physics and Astronomy Departments at the University of Arizona.  The
physics style file, az.sty, was originally written by Mike Coffin in
August 1990; further modifications were made by cjeffery in 1992,
Shamim Mohamed in Summer 1993, and finally Bill Skaggs in Spring 1995.
The astronomy style file, thesis.sty, was written by Kim McLeod in
June 1994; and Brian said that it should be called KiMTeX...

az.cls was written from scratch with format similar to the two style
files described above.  Its main feature is automatic path forwarding
in sub-directories.  For example, suppose that you have a published
paper ms.tex that uses fig1.eps, fig2.eps, ...  You can put all files
into directory sec/.  The figures will be found automatically without
modifying the paths in ms.tex.

az.cls is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
